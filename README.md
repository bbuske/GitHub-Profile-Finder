**GitHub Profile Finder**

This is a small tool, where you can enter a GitHub username and it pulls that user's information into a small form, using the GitHub API. 
It is nothing special and more like a training project, with me playing around. 
Feel free to use it as it and share it, as long as you mention the original author. 
This project is published as is and likely will not receive any patches or updates, unless I decide, to work on it again, or some important security issue or bug needs patching.
If you have any questions or issues, please use the Issues section for the repo, to send a request.
